# Apollonian Gasket Explorer

This is an interactive visualization of the Apollonian Gasket, created with D3.js. The visualization allows users to zoom, pan, and rotate the gasket, and select individual circles to display information about their properties. If the most recent three circles are tangent, the corresponding Pythagorean triple is displayed. If the circles form a Pappus Chain, they glow with a golden color.

## Usage

To view the Apollonian Gasket Explorer, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The visualization should appear in the browser window, and you can use your mouse or touchpad to interact with it. If you select a circle, its properties will be displayed in the info panel.
